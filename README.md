## Assignment 14: Extended Tic-Tac-Toe

Provided is an application that extends the base "TicTacToe" game code to provide a 5x5 grid to play on, as well as updated rules (5 in a row to win) that correspond with the larger game board. Simply click the board to place an "X" or an "O". Each turn alternates between player "X" and player "O" as the board is clicked.

* The application is in .java format, as well as a .jar file that can be executed through the command prompt.

* Running the .jar file needs valid command-line launch arguments to provide required JavaFX SDK packages.
